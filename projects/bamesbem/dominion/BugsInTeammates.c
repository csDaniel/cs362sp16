 ------------------- BUG 1 -------------------------
 
 Description: Adventurer card fails to discard necessary cards
 
 A bug was discovered in the adventurerRefactored() function in the dominion.c file
 
 Classification: Minor bug
 
 Summary: The while loop in the function fails to discard non-treasure
 cards drawn in the course of the operation of the function.
 
 What's the error: A counter variable, int z, inside the function is not
 incremented as non-treasure cards are drawn.
 
 else{
 temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
 state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).
	//z++;
 }
 
 Because the variable is not incremented, and therefore stays at zero
 throughout the operation of the function, the second while loop in the function
 is never executed. This while loop is responsible for discarding the non-treasure
 cards.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 1. Initialize a test gamestate. Copy contents into second gamestate for comparision.
 2. Call adventurerRefactored() and pass in test gamestate
 3. Compare test gamestate discardCount to the second gamestate. The difference should be
 the number of treasure cards drawn (2) plus the difference in the deck count between the
 two gamestates.
 
 Expected vs Actual results:
 The discardCount was three less than expected.
 
 Additional testing information:
 A fourth test was added to my cardtest2.c to discover this bug. My previous tests
 did not test for the discard discrepancies.
 
 -------------------- BUG 2 --------------------------
 
 Description: Smithy card draws too many cards
 
 A bug was discovered in the smithyRefactored() function in the dominion.c file
 
 Classification: Minor bug
 
 Summary: The for loop in the function operates one too many times, resulting in one
 too many cards drawn.
 
 What's the error: The for loop currently reads this: for (i=0; i <= 3; i++), which causes
 the contents of the loop, which in this case is a call to drawCard, to be executed 4 times,
 instead of 3 times.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 1. Initialize a test gamestate. Copy contents into second gamestate for comparision.
 2. Call smithyRefactored() and pass in test gamestate
 3. Compare the handCount variable in both gamestates
 
 Expected vs Actual results:
 The gamestate's handCount was expected to be one less than it is.

 ----------------- Bug 1 -------------------
 
 Title: Adventurer card not discarding all cards
 
 A bug was discovered in the playAdventurer() function in dominion.c
 
 Classification: Minor bug
 
 Description: The bug was discovered in the while loop at the end of the function that is
 responsible for discarding the non-treasure cards that were drawn in the function's previous while loop.
 
 What's the error: The second while loop reads while (z-2 >= 0), when it should instead read
 while(z-1 >=0). The loop does not discard all the cards necessary.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 
 1. Initialize two gamestates
 2. Run one gamestate through the playAdventurer() function
 3. Compare the discardCount of the test gamestate against the original
 The difference should be 2 (the number of treasure cards) + the difference in the deckCount
 of the two gamestates
 
 Additional notes about testing process:
 
 It was necessary for me to add a fourth test to my test suite to catch the bug. The test, found in
 cardtest2.c, is labeled Test 3.
 
 Additionally, during the process of testing, I discovered errors in my own unit tests. My second test originally tested to see if the deckCount in the test game state was decremented by two (the amount of treasure cards drawn). However, this was wrong â€” the change in deckCount comes from both treasure and non-treasure cards. I rewrote the test; it now tests if the test gamestate has fewer cards in the deck than it did previously. In addition, the last of my three tests always failed because of a typo.
 
 
 ---------------- Bug 2 ---------------------
 
 Title: Smithy Card not incrementing playCard after discard
 
 A bug was discovered in the playSmithy() function in dominion.c
 
 Classification: Minor bug
 
 Description: The was discovered in the discardCard() function at the end of the
 playSmithy function(). The bug is involved with the setting of the function's trashFlag.
 
 What's the error: The discard funciton reads discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 1)
 when it should read discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0). The change in the
 trashFlag means that the discardCard function does not add the player's Smithy card to the
 playedCard pile and increment the playedCardCount.
 
 Steps to reproduce:
 
 1. Initialize two gamestates
 2. Run one gamestate through the playSmithy() function
 3. Compare the playedCardCount of the test gamestate against the original
 The difference should be one.
 
 Additional notes about testing process:
 
 It was necessary for me to add a third test to my test suite to catch the bug.
 The test is found in cardtest1.c.
