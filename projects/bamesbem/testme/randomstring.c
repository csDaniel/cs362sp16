 Random Testing Quiz 2
 
 For the inputChar function, I created an array of characters that 
 contained only the characters used in the testMe function
 (they included [, (, {, ' ', a, x, }, ), ]). 
 When the inputChar function was called, it returned a
 random character from the array.
 
 For the inputString functon, I again created an array of characters
 containing only the characters used in the testMe function, which this
 time included only r, e, s, t and \0. When the inputString function
 was called, it returned a random string from the characters in the
 array.
 
 The error is reached when the inputString returns "reset"
 Overall, I found the error was reached in roughly 3000 iterations.
