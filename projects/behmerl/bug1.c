 * CS 362
 * Assignment 3
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * I did find bugs that I had created for the last assignment. 
 * In particular I found that the Great_Hall function was not
 * working and that things were not increasing as intended. 
 * Also, for the function Smithy 3 cards were not added.
 * This is a major bug as it completely changes the game. 
 * The other bug that I found was from the Adventurer function
 * where more treasure was drawn than what was supposed to.
