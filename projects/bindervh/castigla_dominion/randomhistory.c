writeup for observations for Assignment 4


randomtestadventurer:

randomtestadventurer tested discard pile and number of card in the players hand after playing the adventure card
and picking up the 2 treasure cards. Due to the bugs introduced in the beginning of the class, it is expected almost
all tests should fail. There were roughly 5-7 that would pass each round, possibly because of the hand == 0 (meaning
there would be an empty deck). As expected most tests failed. The coverage was 33.33% of 645 which was expected as I only covered these two areas of the code. I could have gotten 
a higher persentage if I had done testing on many more aspects of the game, such as making sure the game successfully ran,
the cards were the correct type added to the hand, etc.


randomtestcard:

randomtestcard tested the smithy card. It tested the success of the card running correctly as well as the number of
cards in the users hand after playing the smithy card and picking up three more cards. Due to bugs introduced earlier 
in the class, I expected all of the tests that dealt with the number of cards in the hand to fail, which they did. 
All of the cardEffect tests passed as expected. While I did not have to test for this, I thought I would to see what the 
code coverage would be with these two tests. It ended up being 33.33% of 645.
