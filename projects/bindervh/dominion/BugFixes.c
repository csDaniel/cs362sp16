Bug Fixes
Heidi Binder-Vitti
Assignment 5

My teammates found bugs in my adventurer and smithy cards that caused the incorrect amount of cards to be drawn. 
I started there with fixing my bugs.  I next fixed all the bugs I had introduced previously.  At this point, I 
ran all of my tests again to see if there were any other bugs I could catch.  All of my tests passed when I ran them
after fixing the bugs I had introduced.  It's possible there are additional bugs in the game that I have not found.
These were likely not found because my test suite does not have 100% coverage of all lines of code in the game.  A 
broader range of inputs or a random tester that runs the entire game with random inputs for all variables might have 
caught more bugs.  As it is, my test suite only covers a select number of cards and functions within the game and is 
not enough to catch all bugs.
