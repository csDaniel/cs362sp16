unittest1.c - getCost()

  getCost() should return the correct cost in coins for the card that is
  passed as a parameter. The tests compare the cost returned by the function
  to the costs given at http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/.

  All tests pass successfully, no bugs found.  
 
  GCOV
    Function 'getCost'
    Lines executed:100.00% of 30
    Branches executed:100.00% of 28
    Taken at least once:100.00% of 28

  Since all the costs returned for all cards are tested, these tests provide
  100% coverage of the function.

unittest2.c - shuffle()

  shuffle() should only reorder the cards in the deck. 
    -  It should not affect the number of cards in any of the card piles for any 
      of the players. 
    -  It should return a value of -1 if the deck is empty when the function is 
      called. 
    - It should not change the cards that are in the deck when it shuffles.

  All tests pass successfully, no bugs found.

    Calls executed:100.00% of 2

  The unit tests cover 100% of the shuffle() function.

unittest3.c - discardCard()

  discardCard():
    - If a card is played not trashed, the card should be added to the discard
      pile and the played card count should increase.
    - If a card is trashed, the card should not be added to the discard pile
      and the played card count should increase.
    - No other players' counts should change

  Bugs found and discussed in bug1.c

    Function 'discardCard'
    Lines executed:100.00% of 13
    Branches executed:100.00% of 6
    Taken at least once:100.00% of 6
    No calls
  
  The unit tests cover 100% of the discardCard() function.

unittest4.c - gameOver()

  gameOver():
    - The Province Supply pile is empty.
    - Any three Supply piles are empty. This includes all the Supply piles, not 
      just the 10 Kingdom card piles that are selected for each game. So, for 
      instance, if the Estate pile, the Curse pile, and one of the Kingdom card 
      piles is empty, the game ends.
