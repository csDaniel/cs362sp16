The first three unit tests covered 5.11%, 6.7%, and 8.64% respectively.
The fourth test got 0%. That not surprising since there was only one
line in the function.

My test did a pretty good job testing all the branch conditions. Admittedly,
I chose some of the easier functions to test, so hitting all the branches
was fairly easy.
