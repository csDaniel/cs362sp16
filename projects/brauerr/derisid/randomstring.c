Q2 - randomstring.c
4/24/16


Based on what is presented in the testme() function there appears to be a need
to generate, randomly, a specific character from a set of characters that the function checks    

From the inputChar function we need to return one of the characters the conditionals in testme check
the c variable for.  This value, per the instuctions must be randomly generated.

From the inputString function we need to generate a random string containing a phrase that consists
of the characters necessary to form the word reset, which the function testme checks for, upon discovering 
this the function testme will terminate while displaying the number of interations it 
took to reach this end.

This code was tested on flip a total of 10 times, that seems to be the going rate these days,
the results are displayed below:

Test #			Iterations
---------------------------
1					3922
2					9438
3					 415

5					2832
