/**
cardtest2.c: Tests the ADVENTURER card.

Basic requirements for the card:
1. Current player should receive exactly 2 cards.
2. Current player should receive only treasury cards.
3. No treasury card should have been discarded.
4. The 2 treasury Cards + discarded cards should come from the player's own pile (pile is decremented)
5. No state change should occur for other players.
6. No state change should occur to the victory card piles and kingdom card piles.

Some possible errors:
(1) One of the treasure cards is never tested, which leads it to be ignored when adding treasure to the player's hand
	//if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
	if (cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)

(2) [error in original file?] The Adventurer card appears not to be discarded after it is played.
    //discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
