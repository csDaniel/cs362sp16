/**
unittest2.c: Tests the discardCard() method

// Basic requirements
1.if flag is set, by end of method, card is added to discard pile
2.if flag is set, by end of method, discard pile counter is incremented by 1; otherwise it does not change
3.by end of method, card is removed from hand.
4.by end of method, decrement number of cards in hand
5.by end of method, other cards in hand are available (no card in hand has value -1)
6. no change to coins, buy or action counts
7. no change to other player's hand
8. No state change to the curse, victory, treasury and kingdom card piles.
