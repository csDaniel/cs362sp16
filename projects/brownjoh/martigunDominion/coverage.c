// Coverage Report
//
// My testing only covered 14.23% of the lines in dominion.cabs
// In order to improve on this metric, I will need to design
// many more tests that cover more functions.
//
// In addition to the low % of lines covered, I also had low branch
// coverage at 15.59%. Once again, expanding my testing to more cards
// and functions will increase these metrics.
