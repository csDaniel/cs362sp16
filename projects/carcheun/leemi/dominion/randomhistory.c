//development of random testers
//
//
//I started out thinking about what I could change to turn my functions into random testers
//From there I decided that I would randomize the deck, the discard pile, and the hand
//in the state of the game. I also randomized the amount of players that the game starts with
//
//Both testers run through 10000 loops and randomize each of the elements I noted above. These random
//tester functions did help me find the previous bugs that I had introduced in addition to some unexpected
//ones
