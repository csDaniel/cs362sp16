/*
* Quiz 2: Random Tester
* Name: Ismail Orabi
* Due: 4/24/2016
*
* inputChar(): This function randomly generates a character based on the
* set of characters used by the testme() function to change the value of the
* state variable. The set of characters I chose to randomly generate are only
* the 9 values that trigger this logic in order to minimize the time spent running
* the random tester, while still executing all the possible cases.
*
* inputString(): This function randomly generates a 6 character string based on
* a set of characters used by the testme() function to print out "error". I chose
* to keep the string the size of what is validated and the characters at what is 
* checked in order to satisfy the test cases without generating excess random inputs.
