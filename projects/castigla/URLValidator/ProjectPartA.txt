1. Explain testIsValid function 
	This function initializes a UrlValidator called urlVal that will check if the url is valid according to the options used.  It creates all possible permutations of urls possible form the testUrlXXX arrays and uses urlVal to test if they are valid.  If the url is valid it prints ‘.’ and if invalid ‘X’ is printed.

2. How many urls are being tested?
	I ran it and placed it in a lined document. It gave me a count of 31,920.

3. How are the urls being built?
	The urls are made up of four parts: <scheme>://<authority><port><path>?<query>. The testIsValid function creates all possible combinations of scheme+authority+port+path+query from the testUrlXXX arrays to test if they are valid.

4. Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url being tested by testIsValid() method.
	
	Valid:
	h3t://www.google.com/test1?action=view
	h3t://www.google.com/test1

	Invalid:
	h3t://0.0.0.0:0/t123?action=view
	h3t://0.0.0.0:0/t123

5.Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator's testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts & complexity)? Explain in few lines. 

They are not much different. Both are testing for specific inputs. The scheme, authority, port, and path are all hard coded and then randomly put together. Both are testing for a specific, expected output. It is, however, a much larger test suite compared to the dominion tests that have been done.
