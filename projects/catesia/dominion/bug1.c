All of the test of non-cards were passed.

I tested the following cards:
    Smithy
    Adventurer
    Village
    Great Hall
All of them had some kind of error in them. Smithy, Adventurer, and Village were all the result of errors i added. Smithy and Adventurer do not discard to right number of cards, and village does not add the correct number of extra actions.
Great hall had a total of three failed tests. It did not discard the correct number of cards, and it caused problems in the action count.
