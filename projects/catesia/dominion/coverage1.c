Here is the coverage output I got after running my tests.
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:32.10% of 651
Branches executed:36.69% of 417
Taken at least once:23.74% of 417

At first this seems fairly low, but once you consider I was only testing 8 funtions in total its not so bad. Looking at block coverage is much more promising as the coverage in areas in which I tested are much higher. This is good news as it implies that my tests did a reasonably good job at error finding.
