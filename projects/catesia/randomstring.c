The first step in writting the random test is to figure out what causes the error message to print. In this case it prints the error message when the program is in state 9 and the inputString ouputes reset.

The inputChar function is fairly simple. All it does is produce a random lowercase letter.

InputString on the other hand creates a random string using a more limited character set in order to speed up the testing.
