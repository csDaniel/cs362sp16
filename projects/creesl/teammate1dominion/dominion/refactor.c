/*
I refactored adventurer, council room, feast, smithy, and village. If a parameter was passed in to cardEffects that was
needed by the function I passed it through to the function. For variables created in cardEffects needed by the function
I just moved them into it.
I added an equal sign to the drawntreasure while loop check in the adventurer function as a bug.
In the council room function I changed it so that it draws 5 cards instead of 4.
In the feast function I changed the for loop that resets the hand so that it resets all but the last card.
I changed smithy so that it only draws 2 cards instead of 3.
