shuffle()		-	No errors
isGameOver()	- 	No errors 
buyCard()		-	ERROR! The hand count did not correctly increase with the buy 

CARD TESTS:

						-	ERROR! deckCount is incorrect.
callAdventurerCard()	-	ERROR! post total is not 2 treasure cards less than pre total. 
						-	ERROR! pre hand count does not equal post hand count.

The bugs found were the bugs introduced by me in Assignment 2, so the tests did their job!
