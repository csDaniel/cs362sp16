For inputChar() i return a random ASCII code. To speed up time, I limited to between the space and the }.
For inputString, I declared a string and filled the first 5 spots in the array with ASCII codes
between e and t. I could have given it a wider range and randomized the number of characters, but
what I did was enough to demonstrate the point. The program will use the inputChar() to eventually
get to 9. This happens pretty quickly. It takes much longer for the inputString to return 'reset'.
But once it does, it will print the error message
