 * The coverage was about 16% 
 * for all of the different tests. 
 * It was successful in finding bugs however. 
 * I think that in terms of Branch coverage it was 
 * difficult to cover every edge. For the smaller
 * functions I definitely have everything tested 
 * but I don't think that I got every edge for all of my tests.
 * I did call each function that I called to be covered. I got 90%
 * of each statements covered in my tests as well. Condition coverage
 * is what my tests does the best. The boolean expressions are all tested.
 *
 * I found that really need to cover all of the other functions
 * and cases that are not part of my unit tests in order to 
 * get a full coverage. 
 *
 * Other cases besides Great_Hall, Smithy, Adventurer, and Village need
 * coverage and all functions besides WhoseTurn, FullDeckCount, 
 * getCost, and isGameover need to be tested in order for there to be coverage.
 * I think that more  branch coverage would also improve the coverage as well.
