Assignment 2

Smith Card: You draw three cards and then discard one from your hand. This is implemented in a
switch statement. It calls the drawCard function to get the three cards and the discardCard function
to get rid of a card.

Adventurer Card: This loops through all of the cards in your
deck until you get two treasures. Once you get those two treasures the while
loop with drawn treasure ends and the other cards that were looped through will be discarded.

Update Coins Method: This adds all of the coins in a player's hand. If it is a Copper
treasure then it is worth 1, Silver is worth 2, and Gold is worth 3. In the end it also adds the bonus.

Discard Card Method: This method discards a card. Many other functions use this to get rid of a card
from a hand. At the end of using this the number of cards in your hand will be reduced by one.
