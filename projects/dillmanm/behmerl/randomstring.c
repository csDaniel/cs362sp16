//Random Testing Quiz 2
//
//I implemented the functions inputChar and inputString
//for random testing so that the error message could 
//print in testme function.
//
//
//For the inputChar I used an array of chars that had 
//both values that were expected and others that were
//not expected in the testme function. If one wanted 
//to further the test they could easily add more values
//to this array. I then have a random number generator in
//order to get a random number that will select randomly
//a char out of the array.
//
//For the inputString function I used a little bit
//of a differenct approach. I first set up an array of 
//strings. I have six different words to be randomly selected 
//though one could easily add more and different words to test.
//I then have a random numer generator so that I will 
//return a random word from this array to pass to testme. 
//
//
//This implementation allows the error message to print
//while using random testing.
