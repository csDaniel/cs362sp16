randomhistory.c

Initially, I was thinking that, although I might need to adjust the randomness later, the main goal was to provide random decks and discards of different (random) sizes and have the player play the card.  After playing the card I could then check for errors, using my unit tests as a guide for what could have gone wrong, and instead of printing error messages, I could simply increase counters for the error, which would allow me to run the test over and over and accumulate the results in an errorCounter struct.  I would then set up the main function to initialize the errorCounter to zeroes, pass it to the random tester and run the tester a large number of times.  I could then analyze the results of the errorCounter and print appropriate messages showing the percent of times each error was encountered.

There was little improvement to the randomtester, as I essentially created a random environment for each game and then played the one card and tested against the game's state before the card was played.  The real strength of the random tester would be the large number of times the program could run and accumulate errors.  The one addition I made was a storage for the random seed value in order to be able to reproduce the results if necessary.  I printed this with the results if it was a rare enough error (less than 10% of the runs).
