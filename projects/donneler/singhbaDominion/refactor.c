Bugs are added as follow:
smithyEffect: In discardCard the parameter is changed to i from 0. 
adventurerEffect: The condition used to check if deck is empty is changed to less than 
				  equal to 1. While loop to discard cards is changed to z >= 0 instead of z â€“ 1 >= 0
councilEffect: numBuy increment execution is removed, so player will never buy a card, which is one of the ability of councilroom card.
feastEffect: For backup Hand loop <= logic is changed to < so last card will never be copied 
			 to temphand. gainCard is moved inside where else if condition state->coins < getCost(choice1), 
			 so player will be able to buy a card more than coins.
