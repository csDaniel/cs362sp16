*
* The random tester has 3 parts the Operation Profile, the Specification Oracle, and the Random Test Case Generator.
* 
* For the testme.c file the Operation Profile is the range of values in which the program operates, it defines the
* input space of values to be tested.  This was left for me to decide, and so I decided that the input space for calls to 
* the function inputChar would be ' ', 'a', 'x' '[', '{', '(', ']', '}', ')', and for the calls to the function 
* inputString the Operational Profile would be any combination of the characters 't', 'e', 's', 'e', 'r'.
* 
* The Specification Oracle judges the correctness of the test point, it defines pass
* fail of a test.  The specification oracle was provided to us in the function testme.  It returns an error when the 
* conditions are met where state = 9 and s = "reset".
*
* The Random Test Case Generator is responsible for generating random values to be tested in a test case.  The functions inputChar and
* inputString generate the random values.  Each call to inputChar returns a random char defined in the operational profile, and each
* call to inputString returns a string also defined in the operational profile.
*
* Code coverage: Examination of the testme.c.gcov file shows the program has 96.15% statement coverage and 100% block coverage.
* Line 37 is missed this line returns 0 if a char from the operation profile is not found in the switch statement in function inputChar, so I would
* not expect this line to execute.  Line 101 is also not executed (return 0 in main), but this line should never execute because 
* the exit function is called from the testme function.  In the testme function the branch coverage of lines 86, 87 88, and 89 is low.  The
* Lines are executed between 1 and 20 times, it would be better if these lines were executed  at a value in line with the other cases in the switch 
* statement (~200's).  It may be that the testme program needs to be run more times to get a better average or the random strings generated may need 
* to be modified to give a better random distribution.
