playSmithy 
draws 4 cards (not 3)
discards smithy card and next card (not only smithy)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
playAdventurer
draws 2 Treasures
if cards are shuffled more than once
	reduce Treasures drawn by 1
(note I think i figured out how to resolve the possible infinite loop bug i thought of)

just in case, 
smithy counts as 1
