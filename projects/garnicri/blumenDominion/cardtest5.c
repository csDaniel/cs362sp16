/**
randomtestcard.c: Tests the REMODEL card.

Basic requirements for the REMODEL card:
0. if pile of card player wants to gain is empty, no change to game and return value = -1
1. Cost of card player trashes + 2 is at least as much as the cost of the card player wants to gain (else return -1)
2. Card that the player wants to gain (choice 2) ends up in player's discard pile
3. Pile of "gained" card is decremented by 1
4. Card that the player wants to trash (choice 1) ends up in trash (not discard pile)
5. Hand count for the player is decremented by 1
6. Except for #3 above, no state change should occur to the victory card piles and kingdom card piles.
7. No change to coin, numBuys or numActions.
8. No state change should occur for other players.

Likely errors in code:

(1) Changed stored card that is trashed from 'choice1' to 'choice2'
-

Random Testing:
    A random tester generates random input from across the population of possible input.
    Sampling biases may be introduced to ensure that specific subpopulations are tested and
    that others are not over-tested.

    Random input for the remodel card:
    - the size & composition of the player's hand, deck and discard are randomized
    - the size & composition of the other player's hand, deck and discard are randomized
    - the number of buys, actions and coins are randomized
    - the sizes of the kingdom, treasury, curse and victory piles are randomized
    - the place in hand of choice1, the card to trash (include error positions)
    - the type of card to trash (incl. its cost, treasury vs. etc., cost relative to choice2) --> this is achieved indirectly through combo random hand + choice1= random place in hand
    - choice2 (incl. its cost, treasury vs. etc.)
    //ALT: I could have set specific choice1 and 2 and their cost dif, but would lost the benefit of the randomization scheme
