I'm most surprised about the lack of total coverage with my unit tests, some of 
this can be explained by my not introducing enough bugs to break the system, when we refine
these tests using the coverage and I have an opportunity to look at the individual test suites
more in depth I can see where some of the branches did not execute fully and increase the overall coverage. Also 
this will help me create a more comprehensive test suite.
