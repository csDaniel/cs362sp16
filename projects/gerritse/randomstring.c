For this weeks quiz we were assigned the task of implementing two functions 'inputChar()' and 'inputString()'. 
The job of these two functions is essentially give a character and string that will be used in the testme function.
The program basically completes when state 9 is reached and the string 'reset' gets input. The function inputChar has
an array of characters that will be useful like the alphabet 



Now even with removing the non-alphabet characters such as {[( the program can still take a very long time to get to the key phrase of 'reset'. 
It gets to state 9 relatively quickly but it took about 800,000 iterations the first time I did with successive runs taking anywhere from 500,000
to over a million. I guess thats the nature of the random though.
