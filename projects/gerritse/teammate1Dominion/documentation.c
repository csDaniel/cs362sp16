Description of smithy
If the smithy card is selected, a for loop begins and loops for three iterations.
After each iteration, the draw card function is called which adds a new card to the playerâ€™s 
hand. After the loop has completed, the smithy card is discarded from the players hand.

/******************************************************************************
Description of adventurer
If the adventurer card is selected, a while loop is run until the player draws a 
treasure card. Within this loop, if it is determined that the remaining deck is found to 
have no remaining cards, then the discarded pile of cards is reshuffled, placed back
in the deck, and then used to draw from. If a copper, silver, or gold treasure card is 
found, then the loop ends. If a treasure card is drawn initially, then that card is placed
into the players hand and the while loop is not activated.

Description of updateCoins
This function sets the initial coins in the players hand to zero. This is then
followed by a loop based on the number of treasure cards in the players hand.
The loop iterates through the treasure cards and adds each copper, silver and
gold coins. The function ends by returning the total number of coins back to
the player.

/***************************************************************************
Description of discardCard
When this function is called, it first checks to see if the card is added to the
trash pile. If it is not trashed, then the card is added to the played pile.
After checking the trashing of the desired card, the number of cards in the players 
hand is reduced by one. From there, the desired card is removed from the players
hand, and the number of cards in the players hand is updated to by -1.
