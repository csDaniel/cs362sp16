It is hard to give a firm take away from the coverage since the test suite that I wrote only covered
four functions and four card implements. Since we were only covering a small part of the code the coverage
might be seem as acceptable. My assumption is that there is always room for improvement. At first I was a
bit lost as to where to start with this assignment. The posting on Testing something vs Testing for business
rules really helped me a lot. It changed the way I started to look at testing. I fully understand my test
are no way up to par. I really have been trying to put in the time to understand the concepts and it has
been a look for me to absorb. By breaking the functions and cards down into easy business case bits it
makes more sense to right tests that way. When looking at the unit tests for the functions I focused more
on making sure that I wrote cases that would test every logic branch in the code base just because the functions
were not very large.
