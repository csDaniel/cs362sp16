// No bugs were found after executing my unit tests and card tests. 
 
// The only card I was a bit concerned about was the Great Hall 
// card because that card adds one victory point and should that 
// count as +1 numHandCards? The test passed only when numHandCards == 5,
// so I guess numHandCards =\= 6? I left comments in cardtest3.c as well
// in regards to this.
