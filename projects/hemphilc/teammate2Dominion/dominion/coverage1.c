# COVERAGE REPORTS

I used branch coverage option for all the unit test codes and 
the short summaries show that most of the test cover about 25% - 60% of the dominion.c code
which I think is pretty good. 

A careful look at the function and test card itself, we can see that the number
associate with that function matches the number of test iterations or unit test Calls.

So if we superimpose all the test results, I would say that the unit tests cover all investigated functions.
The main concentration of the loop is surrounding initializing the game state and setup card piles,
including deck, hand and discarded.
