CS362 Assignment 2

The smithy card can be bought for 4 coins during the buying phase of the round, and if it is in the players hand, it can be played during the action phase of the round.  When the smithy card is played, the player loses an action turn, and gets to draw three cards from their deck.  The player does not get any additional action or buying turns.  In the code for the game, if the smithy card is drawn, then smithyPos is set to whatever position in the hand the smithy card is drawn in to, otherwise its default value is -1.  Then, during the turn, if the card that was chosen was the smithy card, the playCard function is called with the position that the smith card was in the hand as its first parameter.  During the buying phase of the round, the player has an option to buy the smithy as long as they have more than 4 coins, and less than 2 smithies already in their deck.  If they buy the smithy, then the buyCard function is called, and the smithy card is sent in as its first parameter. 
The adventurer card can be bought for 6 coins during the buying phase of the round, and can be played during the action phase if it is in the player’s hand.  When the adventurer card is played, the player turns over cards in their deck until 2 coin cards have been revealed.  All of the non-coin cards are discarded, and the coin cards are put in the player’s hand.  Its game code runs the same way as the smithy card’s does.
The discardCard function has 4 parameters – the position the current card is in the player’s hand, the current player, the state of the game, and a flag.  If the flag has not been set, the game state’s played cards array is updated so that the current card is placed in the first open spot in the array (which is equal to the current number of cards played), and the current number of cards played is incremented.  Then the played card is set to the default value of -1, and it is removed from the player’s hand.  If that card was the last card in the hand, or there is only one other card in the hand, the player’s number of cards is decremented, otherwise, the cards are all slid down one to take the place of the discarded card, and then the number of cards in the player’s hand is decremented.
The updateCoins function has three parameters – the player, the game state, and a bonus.  The first thing this function does is reset the coin count to zero just to make sure the player doesn’t start with extra coins that they didn’t play.  Then, if the player plays a copper coin card, 1 is added to the coin count, if they play silver coin card, 2 is added to the coin count, and if they play a gold coin card, 3 is added to the coin count.  Finally, the bonus is added to the coin count.
