// councilRoomCard() test

// This file tests the councilRoomCard() card effect.

// What to test:
    // Player's handcount increased by 3 more cards (+4 - 1 = 3)
    // Player's number of buys increased by 1
    // Remaining players' handcounts increased by 1 more card
    // Check that council_room card has been replaced by next card in hand
    // Player's draw pile reduced by 4 cards (deckcount - 4)
    // Remaining players' draw piles reduced by 1 card each
