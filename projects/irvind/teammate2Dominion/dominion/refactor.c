//Assignment 2, part 3
//
//Cards: adventurer, council_room, feast, mine, smithy
//
//
//adventurer:
//	Change -> Added adventurerCard() function (line 12), and refactored cardEffect() switch case adventurer to call adventurerCard().
//
//	Bug -> I changed the drawntreasure conditional in the while statement to be less than 3 rather than 2, which would allow an additional treasure card to be drawn. BLING BLING!
//			    while(drawntreasure<2) -->     while(drawntreasure<3){
//
//
//council_room
//	Change -> Added councilRoomCard() function (line 36), and refactored cardEffect() switch case council_room to call councilRoomCard().
//
//	Bug -> I changed the number of buys added by this card to 5, so the player will now have 5 additional buys rather than 1.
//			    state->numBuys+=1 --> state->numBuys+=5
//
//feast:
//	Change -> Added feastCard() function (line 62), and refactored cardEffect() switch case feast to call feastCard().
//	
//	Bug -> No bugs added to this card.
//
//
//mine:
//	Change -> Added mineCard() function (line 116), and refactored cardEffect() switch case mine to call mineCard().
//
//	Bug -> I changed the toFlag of the gainCard() function to 0, so that the card will not be added to the handcount.
//
//	    gainCard(choice2, state, 2, currentPlayer); -->  gainCard(choice2, state, 0, currentPlayer);
//
//smithy:
//	Change -> Added smithyCard() function (line 157), and refactored cardEffect() switch case smithy to call smithyCard().
//	Bug ->	I allowed for an additional card to be drawn by playing the smithy card:
//		    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) -->  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
//
//
