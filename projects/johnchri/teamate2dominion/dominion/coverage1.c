For the cardtests, the tests for playSmithy, playVillage, and playCouncil_Room achieved 100% statement coverage. This can be seen by examining the dominion.c.gcov file. Every line of codes in these three functions has been run at least once. The coverage for playAdventurer was not as good, however, since a significant number of statements were not executed. This resulted since there are a variety of cards that can be drawn, with the treasure and nontreasure cards being handled differently. I plan to improve this test in the future by constructing a variety of deck arrangements so that the treasure cards are spaced out differently.

For the method tests, handCard, updateCoins had 100% statement coverage. GainCard had nearly full statement coverage, however, it did not encounter a case where it tried to gain a card where the supply had been fully depleted. The unit test should be altered to include such a case in the future. DiscardCard missed two possible braches, namely when the player has exactly one card in her hand before discard, and when the player discards the last card in the card array. Again, the unit test should be altered to include these cases in order to obtain better coverage.

The relevant portions of the dominion.c.gcov file are shown below for reference:
