Random Test Adventurer
	I switched to creating an empty game state the initializing a game.  Then I would randomly
	generate the information I was testing for.  I ending up using rand() for my testing I couldn't get the provided function to work right. I changed the tester to use random values up to 50 for handCount, deckCount, and discardCount.  The test coverage was 100% for the adventurer
	card. I changed the tester to use random values up to 50 for handCount, deckCount, and discardCount.  The test coverage was nearly 100% for the adventurer
	card.
	
Random Test Council Room
	I also used a MAX size of 50 insteand of MAX HAND for testing the council room. The test coverage was 100% for the council room.
