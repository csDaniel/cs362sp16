I kind of cheated and made this super easy for myself. I basically gave it only the characters that we could possibly want
this made it super easy to get what we wanted.

I took this approach after we had a project at work where we were trying to figure out if our data analytics tool
was working correctly and we randomly assigned grade letters to a lot of data.

I also made it easier on myself for the inputString function by passing a pointer to the string and returning that directly
this allowed me to not have to worry about memory allocation.

I do think that A better test would be to use a broader character set and use the full ascii alphabet, or even the full
ascii character chart.
