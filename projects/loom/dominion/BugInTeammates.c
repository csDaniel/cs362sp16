 * Lessons learned:
 *
 * Firstly, I learned, as we can see, that my tests should be a little (a lot) more verbose.  Luckily in this code
 * it is very simple so I could indentify the issues more easily, but it still could stand to have more verbiage.
 *
 * Secondly, I learned I should make my tests more general.  In my original tests, I tested the functions we created
 * for the cards.  However, when running my tests, I had to modify them to test only the original function, as some people
 * did not choose to create specific functions for the cards.  Therefore, my tests were not general enough to be good
 * tests on their own.
