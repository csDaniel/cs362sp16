Randomtestadventurer

This code was pretty simple to test the very simple features of the card.  All it
does is make sure the deck has no treasure card as well as the players hands.

It then randomly adds two treasure cards to the deck and records their value.  This ensures
that they will be chosen.  It plays the adventure card, and then checks the value of the
hand of the player.  If the player has the same amount of value in his hand that was
added to the deck, the test passes.  This test fails very often.  I believe this is
due to the fact that I introduced many bugs into the adventurer card, as the test does
pass occassionally so we know that it isn't a flawed test.

Interestingly, I tried to add more randomness by randomly choosing a player, but
kept having floating point errors with the random function.  I was unable to determine
why this was, though, none of my tests were fruitful, so it always tests the first player.
