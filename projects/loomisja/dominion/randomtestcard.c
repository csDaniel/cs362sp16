** Program Filename: randomtestcard.c
** Author: Jason Loomis
** Date: 5/8/16
** Description: CS 362, Assignment 4
**		Random test for the Smithy card effect.
** Rule: +3 Cards
** Randomized Parameters:
**		The gameState input is randomized using randomizeGameState, which
**		randomizes the parameters as follows:
**			numPlayers: 2 <= numPlayers <= MAX_PLAYERS
**			supplyCount: all kingdom, treasure, victory, curse cards between 0
**				and game initial counts
**			embargo: if embargo is in the kingdom, embargo tokens may be
**				may be applied to any kingdom supply piles; the number of
**				tokens applied is up to (10 - # embargoes remaining in supply)
**			outpostPlayed: if outpost is in the kingdom, with a 1/32 chance,
**				outpostPlayed flag is set to up to (10 - # outposts remaining
**				in supply)
**			outpostTurn: if the outpostPlayed flag is non-zero, outpostTurn
**				is set to a value between 0 and 2.
**			whoseTurn: a player between 0 and (numPlayers - 1) is selected
**			numActions: random value between 0 and 10 (arbitrary)
**			coins: random value between 0 and 20 (arbitrary)
**			numBuys: random value between 0 and 10 (arbitrary)
**			cards counts: a cardcount is selected, between 0 and MAX_HAND,
**				this value is then randomly divided among the deck, hand, and
**				discard for each player; for the current player (whoseTurn),
**				the distribution includes the played cards as well.
**			cards: for the count of cards specified, the deck, hand, and
**				discard are chosen randomly from among the kingdom, treasure
**				victory, and curse cards; for the current player (whoseTurn),
**				the playedCards are chosen as well.
**			cardToPlay + handpos: for the current player (whoseTurn), the
**				player's hand is specified to have at least 1 card and that
**				card is specified to be cardToPlay and is set at any valid
**				handpos for that player's hand.
** Oracles:
**		Note: If any oracle fails, the test is failed.
**		1) Check that the played card count has increased by exactly 1
**		2) Check that exactly 1 CARDUNDERTEST has been added to the played cards
**		3) Check that number of cards in player's hand/played has increased
**			by exactly 3*
**		4) Check that number of cards in player's deck/discard decreased by
**			exactly 3*
**		5) Check that number of cards in player's hand/played increased by
**			exactly the number that the deck/discard decreased
**		6) Check that the cards in player's hand/played increased by exactly
**			the cards that the deck/discard decreased by
**		7) Check that the state of other players didn't change
**		8) Check that the state of the supply cards (kingdom, treasure,
**			victory, curse) are unchanged.
**		9) Check other gameState fields (numPlayers, whoseTurn, etc.)
**		*unless the the deck/discard contained fewer than 3 cards, in which
**		case the number increased by the number of cards in the deck/discard
** Seeds:
**		The random seed indicated with each test iteration provides a means of
**		reproducing that test (i.e. regenerating the same sequence of random
**		numbers that were used). And the sequence seed can be used to reproduce
**		a sequence of tests.
