inputChar()

	This function will produce a character with ASCII values between 32 and 95

inputString()

	This function will produce a string of length 5, the string will be the 26
 	lower case alphabets

How it finds error?

	testme() runs until it hits stage 9 and then it iterates until the string
	“reset” has been generated. When it does, it prints out “error” and 
	exits the program. 

My iteration stopped at 21,069,271.
