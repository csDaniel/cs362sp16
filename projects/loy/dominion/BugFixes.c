// I couldn't do part 2 of this assignment as intended because 
// I will be traveling for a wedding. I did contact my teammates
// and told them I need to finish this assignment very quickly
// and probably won't be able to wait for them to find my bugs.
// I also told the instructor about my situation so he knows. 

// For part 1, I didn't catch a lot of bugs with my tests. I
// realized that my tests weren't detailed enough. I see it now
// but I didn't know how detailed they needed to be when I was
// doing the assignments. 

// As for my own bugs, the bugs I introduced were: 
// 1) Smithy: draw 4 cards instead of 3
// 2) Adventurer: reveal 3 treasure cards instead of 2
// 3) Council room: draw 3 cards instead of 2, no additional buys
//                  , and only current player gets additional cards
// 4) Village: no action added
// 5) Feast: gain a card up to 6 cost instead of 5

// All the bugs I introduced for assignment 2 were fixed.
