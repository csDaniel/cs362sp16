// For the Adventurer card, the card 
// itself did not discard after being played. I have 
// the same bug for my own adventurer test.

// My actual card/unit tests didn't catch any bugs simply
// because they did not test the bugs he introduced. I 
// caught the adventurer bug with my random test for it,
// so I had to read his refactor.c to see where some of the 
// bugs are. I only caught one bug from him.

// For the Smithy card, the bug is from player drawing 
// more than three cards.

// My tests didn't pick up anything else again, so I read
// his refactor.c to make sure my tests didn't fail and
// they didn't. The bugs were introduced into other parts
// that my test was not based on.
