/****************************** BUGS FOUND *******************************/
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) shuffle() function is broken, does not shuffle when deck is 0 like
it is supposed to.

2) fullDeckCount() does not return anything but 0 regardless of how many
cards are in the deck/hand/discard.

3) adventurer card does not discard itself after being played. At this time,
I'm really not sure if this is a bug or if it is how the card is supposed 
to work.
