	Starting with statement coverage (Lines executed), the unit tests had a low coverage of 76.79% and a high coverage 95.45. Unit test 1 had 
	four tests associated with it, and out of the 95 lines, 86.32% of those were covered. Unit test 2 had three tests associated with it, and out
	of the 66 lines, 95.45% of those lines were covered. Unit test 3 had two tests associated with it, and out of the 56 lines, only 76.79%. Due 
	to a lack of additional tests is probably one of the reasons that unit test 3 had such a low coverage compared to the other unit tests. 
	Lastly, unit test 4 had three tests associated with it, and out of the 53 lines, 94.34% of those lines were covered.

	Next, the statement coverage for the card tests produced a low coverage of 72.09% with a high of 95.45% statement coverage. Starting with 
	the Adventure card, only 72.09% of the lines were executed. One reason for this low coverage was possibly caused by the bug a failed test. 
	Because of this bug, the remaining code possibly could not be executed correctly. Moving on to the Smithy card, 95.45% of the 22 lines of 
	code were executed and a bug was detected. The Council room test had 93.62% of the 47 lines executed with two bugs detected. Lastly, 
	the Minion card had 92.94% of the 85 lines executed with 3 bugs being detected. With unit test
	
	With reviewing the branch coverage information gained, unit test 1 execute 86.96% of the branches were executed out of the 46 lines.
	Unit test 2 had 100% branch coverage over the 54 lines of code.  Unit test 3 showed 87.50% branch coverage over 16 lines of code. 
	Lastly, unit test 4 also had 100% branch coverage over the 24 lines that were executed.
	
	Moving on to the branch coverage for the card tests, the adventure card only had 57.14% coverage. Again, this low coverage percentage
	was possible caused by the bug that was discovered. The Smithy card had 100% branch coverage with only 4 lines being executed. The Council
	Room also had 100% branch coverage with its 12 lines that were executed. Lastly, the Minion card had 100% branch coverage of its 
	34 lines that were executed. 	 
	
	When going over the dominion statement coverage, which only had 18.20% of 566 lines of code executed. 
	This is obviously an extremely low coverage percentage. However, the branch and statement coverage of the unit 
	and card tests provided fairly high percentages, minus the adventure card test.
