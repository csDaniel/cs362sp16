My unit tests were able to catch all the bugs that I introduced in Assignment 2.
It was also able to catcht that when the adventurer card was played that
the function didn't call for the card to be discarded. The function also didn't take
as a parameter a position to help indicate where in the player's hand to discard
the card.
