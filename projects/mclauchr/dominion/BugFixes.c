** Description:  This is a text file that will discuss the 
** the process of fixing the bugs that were found in my 
** teammates source code; in addition to my own.
**
** NOTE: BugsInTeammates.c describes only 2 bugs for each 
** teammate.  In some cases, tests revealed more than the 
** required 2 that needed to be reported for assignment #5.
** I will attempt to fix all that were found during testing.
