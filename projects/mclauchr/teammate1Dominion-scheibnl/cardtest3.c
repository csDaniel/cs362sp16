** Description: card test for great_hall card. For this card we must
** look at these important features of the card effect:
**		1. Verify that a single additional card is added to the current
**		   players hand, and then discarded as a played card
**		2. Verify that the number of actions has been incremented
**		3. Verify that no other players decks have been altered.
**		4. Verify that the cardEffect for great_hall returns 0
