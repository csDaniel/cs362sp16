**
** Description:  This card test will test the Adventurer card effect
** the most important portions of the card effect to verify include:
**		1. The current players handCount must be = + 1 more than original
**		2. The current player should have two additional TREASURES
**		3. All drawn cards / discarded cards are from current player's
**		   Deck.
**		4. cardEffect for Adventurer returns successfully
**		5. cardEffect for Adventurer returns a Zero, even if discarded
**		   the player's deckCount = 0;
