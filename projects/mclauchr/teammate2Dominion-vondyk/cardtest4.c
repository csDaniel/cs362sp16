**
** Description: this card test evaluates the embargo card effect. The
** important features to verify include:  
**		1. Verify +2 coins are added to the current state
**		2. Verify that the embargo card is trashed. This means that the 
**		   players deckCount should be decremented.
**		3. Verify that embargo token for a specific kCard is incremented
**		4. Verify that other players deckCounts are unaltered.
**		5. Verify that cardEffect will return without error with 
**		   an appropriate choice 1
**		6. Verify that the an incorrect "choice" of where to put an 
**		   embargo token will result in an error.
