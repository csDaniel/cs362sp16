/*
The general coverage for the unit and card tests was pretty good. The lowest coverage I got was for the init tests at
79%. I thought I might not get everything since the init was one of the larger functions to cover. I tried to pick the
functions to test that made the most sense to test, such as ones that had more logic and were depending on more varying options.
My code coverage didn't make it to 100% on any of the tests but every test had 100% branch coverage. I think I have to
be more careful making sure I cover everything. I think the tests however are fairly good. Code coverage is not a
perfectly good indicator of how well a function is tested.
