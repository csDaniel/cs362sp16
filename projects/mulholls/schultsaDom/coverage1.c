coverage1.c

unittest1.c 
Executes updateCoins 85 times with return rate 100%. Blocks executed at 64%
In order to raise my block coverage I should think about more boundary conditions.

unittest2.c
Executes gainCard 56 times and returned 100% with 90% of the code blocks executed.
This seems to be a good unit test.

unittest3.c
Executes discardCard called 43 times with 100% return rate at 78% of total code being executed.
I need to make sure I am covering all possible branhces within the function.

unittest4.c
Calls fullDeckCount 320 times with 100% return rate and 82% code coverage.

cardtest1.c
called smithy 6 times and returned 100% of the time with 80% code coverage.
I had to disable an assertion that was crashing in order to get the logs so actual coverage may be higher.

cardtest2.c
called adventurer 3 times and returned 100% of the time with 100% code coverage.

cardtest3.c
called remodel 2 times, returned 100% of the time with 100% code coverage.

cardtest4.c
called village once and returned 100% of the time, code coverage is 100%.
