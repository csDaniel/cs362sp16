Randomtestadventurer.c seemed to flow pretty easily from the unit test for the adventurer card. I randomized the seed, number of players and the cards each player had in their decks. A lot of the same tests apply, for example checking the number of victory cards before and after the card play. One change I included was putting the print statements inside the if statements. Because I broke the adventurer card in the 2nd assignment, the random tester finds lots of errors so I only do 30 random tests. However it is easy to increase the number of tests. I also thought it would be appropriate to include the seed and number of players to recreate any errors found. I also put the tests in functions to make the loop easier to follow the tests flow. 
Randdomtestcard flowed very easily from randomtestadventurer.c. I simply had to change the variables in regards to how many cards are drawn. I’m not sure this would be the norm in real life settings. I’m sure there would be lots of similarities in some unit tests in some settings. However in the dominion game there are a lot of similarities between each of the cards. 
This assignment also made me think about and question what the testing scope should be. At first I thought I should include some corner cases, but after thinking more about it I think corner cases would be covered by nonrandom unit tests. Also I thought about randomizing some of the parameters to cardeffect but decided not to because they don’t have an effect on smithy or adventurer cards. I think including a random choice would be used on a random test for cardeffect(). This choice also effected the coverage metrics in the gcov out files. For example one of the corner cases for adventurer is the deck needs has no more treasure cards in it. This corner case, in my opinion, shouldn’t be left to a random chance the deck cards will not have treasure cards in it, thus my coverage isn’t 100%.
