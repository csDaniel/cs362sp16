I noticed a bug in the shuffle function. I don’t believe it ever shuffles the cards. This is a bug in its function could that’s compares the players deck count and if it is greater than one it simply returns and doesn’t shuffle. 
	I also noticed some bugs in the adventurer function. 2 of which I created. One allows for more than 2 treasure cards to be collected. The also noticed the adventurer card does not get discarded. 
		I also detected a couple errors I put into the Council room card. One prevents one of the players from drawing a card. The other allows the player of the card to acquire an additional card. 
			My program also detected the error I injected into the smithy card. One of witch calls discard on the next player. This also changes the proper in hand count of the player. 
				All and all I found this to be a very fun and rewarding exercise. I don’t think I would have found the bugs I injected had I not know they were there. In closing total understanding of the code your testing may very well be the key to effective testing.
