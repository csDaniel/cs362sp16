----smithy---
Calling the smithy card simply draws three cards for the current player by calling drawCard() 
three times, then discards the smithy card by calling discardCard() for the current player  

---adventurer---
Calling the adventurer card does the following until the number of treasure cards drawn is 2 (the point of this card
is to have the current player draw until two treasure cards are found and add those cards into the player's hand):
1. Check the current players deck with deckCount and if it is empty, refill it by calling shuffle()
2. Draw a card with drawCard() (place the card in the player's hand)
3. If the card drawn is a treasure card, increase the number of treasure cards drawn by 1;
Else place the drawn card into a temporary hand (remove it from the current player's hand) and increase the count of 
cards in the temporary hand.
4. Repeat back to 1 until the number of treasure cards drawn is 2
5. Discard all of the cards in the temporary hand.
