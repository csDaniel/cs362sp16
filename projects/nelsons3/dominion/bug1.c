No bugs found in any of the 4 unit tests

Smithy works appropriately

Adventurer appears to be keeping all cards drawn instead of discarding
non treasure cards.  I have to assume this as instead of my new hand
size being a 7 (5+2) it is 9 (5+4).  In all actuality, the hand size 
should be 6 instead of 7 as the adventurer card is consumed in the process
so it would actually be (5+2-1).

Garden works appropriately 

Council_room works as intended
