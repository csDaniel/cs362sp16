Unit test1 and unit test2 had 100% coverage while unit test 3 (getCost()) had 98.39% coverage.  
It appears that the outpost did not register as a value of 2 and caused the printf not to run
which shows why it was not a 100% coverage.  Will look into this later. Unit test 4 had 81.25% coverage
which suggests that some of the elseif's or if's did not run.  

Of the card tests 1-4, Smithy had a 92.31% coverage where one of the if's wasn't triggered, Adventurer/Garden/and council_room 
all had 100% coverage rates.

Dominion had a 41.07% coverage rate.
