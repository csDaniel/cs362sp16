/* Random Test for Adventurer
`* Previous game state: playing 2-4 player Dominion game, Adventurer card is played
 * Tests will cover:
 *   - if hand count was increased by 2
 *   - if adventurer remains in hand after playing
 *   - if 2 treasure cards were added
 *   - if Adventurer card is discarded
 *   - if deck count is decreased by at least 2
 *   - other player has no game state change 
 *   - same deck count
 *   - same hand count
 *   - same discard count	
 *   - same cards in hand
 *   - same cards in deck
 *   - same cards in discard
 *   - no game state change	
 *   - same players
 *   - same supply count for each card
 *   - same embargo token count for each card
 *   - same outposed played 
 *   - same outpost turn
 *   - same whose turn
 *   - same phase
 *   - same number of actions
 *   - same number buys
