/* Random Test for Village
   Previous game state: playing 2-4 player Dominion game, Village card is played
   Tests will cover:
   - if hand count was unaltered
   - if deck count is decreased by 1
   - if number actions increased by 2
   - if village card is discarded
   - if next card is moved to the hand
   - if village remains in hand after playing
      - other player has no game state change 
		- same deck count
		- same hand count
		- same discard count	
		- same cards in hand
		- same cards in deck
		- same cards in discard
	- no game state change	
		- same players
		- same supply count for each card
		- same embargo token count for each card
		- same outposed played 
		- same outpost turn
		- same whose turn
		- same phase
		- same number of actions
		- same number buys
