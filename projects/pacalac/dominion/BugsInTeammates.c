Nicely, no refactoring was required to run my teammates code. Tests were run using the makefile from previous
assignments.


clinedim Bugs found:

unittest4.c, testing the buy coins function failed. Looking at the code, gainCard incorrectly adds a card
	to the discard instead of the hand.
All other unit tests and random tests found no bugs.
