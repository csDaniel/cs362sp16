Adventurer - The statement coverage for the playAdventurer function improved over the unit test. Before, the 
	unit test did not check the function when there was an empty deck (requiring a reshuffle of the discard pile).
	With 1000 tests, the deck was shuffled 24 times in this case.
	
Smithy - The statement coverage for playSmithy did not improve (as the unit test had complete statement coverage).
	However the statements were covered at least 1000 times instead of only once indicating a more thorough test.
