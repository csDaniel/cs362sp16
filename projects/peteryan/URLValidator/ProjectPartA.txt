How testIsValid Works
The function is passed an object array that contains arrays for the url part.  The arrays of url parts contain ResultPairs.  
A ResultPair is a string for the url part and boolean indicating if it is a valid or invalid URL.  The URL parts used are 
testUrlScheme, testUrlAuthority, testUrlPort, testUrlPath, and testUrlQuery.  testUrlScheme is the protocol, testUrlAuthoriey 
is the IP address, testUrlPort is a port number, testUrlPath is the path to a web page, and testUrlQuery is query strings.  
testIsValid constructs url strings by creating a StringBuilder and creates a string adding a scheme, authority, port, path, 
and then a query.  The expected result is created by using bitwise &= with the boolean for each part used to create the string.  
If all parts used are valid the expected result is true.  The url is passed to urlVal.isValid to test if the url is valid.  The 
return value is a boolean and stored in result.  If result is true the url is printed to the screen.  If printStatus is true, 
‘.’ will be printed if the result is the same as the expected result and ‘X’ if result and expected result are different.  The 
function tests all combinations of testUrlScheme, testUrlAuthority, testUrlPort, testUrlPath, and testUrlQuery.

This real world test is not much different than the unit test and card test that we have been doing for class.  It concept is 
fairly straight-forward.  It builds url strings and gives the a boolean value for valid or invalid.  The url is passed to the 
function that is tested and the result is compared to the expected results.  The unit test we have been doing follow the same 
procedure; create input, pass input to function, and compare expected results and actual results.  The decision making for 
strings and the loop control are a little more complex than what we have been doing.  The people who wrote the program have 
more experience so they have the knowledge to make the test more concise by using more complex logic.
