	DiscardCard function
	
	This function takes card(s) flagged as trash cards and then removes them from the player's hand. Also accounts for situations where cards get replaced.
	Also worth noting, there is a if statement dedicated to the scenario in which the player only has one card in their hand. In this case the removed card
	is also replaced.

/*
updateCoins function

//This function resets the coins to be added to the player's total and then tallies up the next set of treasures to be added from the player's hand.



tests: updateCoins and scoreFor and numHandCount
numHandCount difficulties: The second player's hand count is shared with the first player's. Solved this by telling the function that the hand has five cards as I believe
the error was just due to the variable for the gamestate.
