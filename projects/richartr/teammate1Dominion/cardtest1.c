/************************************
* Name: Trent Richardson
* Class: CS362-400
* Assignment 3 - cardtest1.c
* Description: CardTest for playSmithy()
*  1. Adds 3 cards from the current player's own deck or discarded pile to the current player's hand.
*  2. Adds the smithy card that was just played to the player's discard deck.
*
* References: cardTest4.c provided to use as example and template
* Notes: playSmithy is refactored code, so not all tests will pass.
