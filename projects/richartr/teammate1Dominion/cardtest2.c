* Name: Trent Richardson

* Assignment 3 - cardtest2.c
* Description: Unit test for: playAdventurer()
*  1. Draw cards from discard and deck until two treasures drawn
*  2. Cards drawn must be put into discard pile if not treasure
*
* References: cardTest4.c provided used as template
* Notes: playAdventurer is refactored code, so not all tests will pass.
