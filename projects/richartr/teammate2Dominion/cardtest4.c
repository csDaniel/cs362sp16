/************************************
* Name: Trent Richardson
* Class: CS362-400
* Assignment 3 - cardtest3.c
* Description: Unit test for: playVillage()
*  1. Adds 1 card from the deck or discard pile to player hand
*  2. Increases the player action by 2
*  3. Moves played village card to the player's discard pile.
*
* Notes: playVillage is refactored code, so not all tests will pass.
