// randomtestadventure.c 
// 
// The first thing that I considered when developing randomtestadventure is how the the inputs could be randomized.
// The playAdventurer function's only input is a game state, so a way to randomize the varaibles in the struct gameState 
// while keeping each of them within a valid range was needed. 

// First I randomized the number of players for each iteration of the random test
// Next, I randomly selected the cards that would make up the deck, hand, and discard of each player
// Next, I incremeted a varaible for the number of treasure cards the current player has total
// Finally, with all of the proper inputs randomized, I ran the following tests

	// 1. 
	// 2.
	// 3.
