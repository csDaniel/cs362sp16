/*
My random tester searches from a set of acceptable characters and randomly selects 1 to return.

My inputString function uses inputChar function to fill in an array that can hold 5 characters and a null terminator.
The conditions for the error to trigger is for the string to be filled in as "reset\0" which is possible with the way the string gets generated.
