Assignment 5
Filename: BugsInTeammates.c

Team Member: Heidi Binder-Vitti

Card Tested: Smithy
Bug Found: One too many cards drawn

Card Tested: Adventurer
Bug Found: Function is counting cards as treasure when they are not. e.g. the
card drawn would be an estate and the function would count it as treasure drawn


Team Member: Ashley Castiglione

Card Tested: Smithy
Bug Found: The number of cards added to hand was incorrect

Card Tested: Adventurer
Bug Found: Number of cards added to hand is incorrect


For the testing both card test files for smithy and adventurer proved helpful. For
the adventurer cards I also needed to use my random test to find more specifically
why the bugs were occuring other than then hand size being incorrect.
