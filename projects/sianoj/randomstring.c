In the input char function, I made an array of the possible characters, then randomly returned one of those characters.

For the inputString function, I made an array of the possible characters, then returned a correctly sized array with the null terminator in the right place that was a permuatation of the possible character. 

This will first check for the correct character, and when it finds the correct character, it will implement the counter until the counter hits 9.  Then, it will check the string against the word reset, and if the counter is 9 and the word is reset, the error prints.
