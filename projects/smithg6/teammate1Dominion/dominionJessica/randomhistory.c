By randomizing my test results, I recieved better coverage, which is what I expected.  In the first test, I randomized the seed number, and in the test for adventurer, I randomized both the seed number and the player that was having their card tested.  Because of the bugs that I introduced in both the smithy and the adventurer cards, my tests did not pass, but on the adventurer card I did get full branch coverage, and my line coverage is up to 80%.  For the smithy card, my coverage wasn't as good, with branch coverage only at 55% and statement coverage at 60%.  I attribute this to less randomization.
