    test coverage1.c


The coverage results showed me 28.13% of lines being covered,
 23.1 of branches excecuted, and 17.2% of paths taken at least
 of calls that are being excecuted. It's evidently that a lot 
 of improvement can be made here to increase effectivness for 
 the functions. Some of the tests showed 100% coverage, however, 
 that doesn't mean 100% effectiveness of the program. There are 
 plenty of important functions that need more testing in order 
 for the whole program running smoothly, because if one function 
breaks it can mess up the whole gameplay.
