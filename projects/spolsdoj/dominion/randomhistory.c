Random Test Adventurer Card

Tests Run: 100
Coverage: 22.44%

The coverage of my code base has improved a bit. The main objective of my test was to verify
the game states after multiple runs of the Adventurer card was active. The test suite would
validate if both the hand count and deck count of the cards were correct after each adventurer
card was played in the loop. The game state would be initialized in the beginning of each loop
iteration. The initial state of the hand and deck count variables are copied to veriables and
passed to a function that checks to see if the card producted the correct effects. 

Random Test Village Card

Tests Run: 1000
Coverage: 22.4% 

The coverage of my code base remains the same. The main objective of my test was to verify that
the game state after multiple runs of the Village card was active. Like the adventurer card the
test validates both the hand count and deck of the cards in the players hand after the Village card
effect has been played. The game state is initialized in the beginning of each loop iteration. The
state of each hand is saved to variables and compared to see if a valid Village card effect took
place.
