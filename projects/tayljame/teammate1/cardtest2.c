Card test for adventurer_ref()

    adventurer_ref: test that player coin count increase by the value of two added coin cards.
                    Test that all other drawn cards are sent to discard. Default implementation will draw 3 cards:
                        Estate, Copper, Copper.
                    Tests will verify that resulting game states reflects +2 to coin count of player hand and
                    adding Estate card to discard pile.
