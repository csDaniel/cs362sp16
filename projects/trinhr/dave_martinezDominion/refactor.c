smithyCard()
--The loop will run five times instead of three so it will draw five cards
instead of three.  

adventurerCard()
--After the drawn card function, the drawntreasures variable is incremented by one. Thus 
the while loop will only run once or twice at most. There will be two different scenarios. 
It'll run once after the player draws one card and the  the first card is a treasure card. 
It'll run twice after the player draws two cards regardless if there were treasure cards
or not.

villageCard()
--This card is supposed to allow the player to draw one card and allot them two additional actions.
 However, this will reset the number of actions to two, without accounting for any other action bonuses 
or other action points they might have accumulated previously.
Original: state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;
Edit: state->numActions = 2;

stewardCard()
--I removed the second branch for the if else if else statement. So now for the first branch if choice1 == 1, it will
now give the player both 2 cards and 2 coins. It will not account for when choice1 == 2 and will default
to letting the player discard two cards instead. Previously, the first branch choice1==1 will only let the player draw two
cards and the second branch choice1==2 will let the player get 2 coins.

cutPurseCard()
--This card adds two coins to the player, but it also makes other players lose a copper card or reveal their hand if they have no copper. I removed the break from the loop that goes through each opponnent's hand to remove the first copper. Now it'll remove all the coppers from the player's hand instead of just stopping after the first removal.
