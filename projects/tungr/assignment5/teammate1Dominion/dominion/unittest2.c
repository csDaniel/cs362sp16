	(20 points) Write unit tests for four functions (not card implementations or cardEffect) in dominion.c. 
	Check these tests in as unittest1.c,unittest2.c, unittest3.c, and unittest4.c. 
	(for example, you can create a test for updateCoins() method)
	
	Testing:
		int whoseTurn(struct gameState *state);
