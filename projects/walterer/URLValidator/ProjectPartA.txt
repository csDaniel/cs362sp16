The testIsValid() function in UrlValidator is working by setting 
up URLs and allowing any scheme. This means that the URL is not 
required to have http, https, ftp, etc. It is testing 35,910 URLs, 
which is the product of all the combinations testUrlScheme, testUrlAuthority, 
testUrlPort, testPath, testUrlQuery.It is building the URLs by 
cycling through the arrays of ResultPairs for testUrlScheme, 
testUrlAuthority, testUrlPort, testPath, testUrlQuery to build 
all combinations of URLs. A valid URL is “http://www.google.com” 
and an invalid URL is “.aaa”. I think real world tests have similar 
concepts to the tests that we have been using for unit and card tests. 
However, I think that many real world tests are far more complex. 
The reason these tests are more complex is because there are many 
different variables affected throughout testing. Also, the results 
may not be as cut-and-dry as we see with unit and card tests. 
But, I think the overall concepts would remain the same.
