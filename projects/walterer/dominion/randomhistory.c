/* Random Test Adventurer */

/* I set the deck, discard, and hand to random amounts and then
filled the hand with random cards. Then I put an adventurer card
in the player's hand. After this, I checked how the deck, discard, 
hand, and treasure had changed. According to Dominion rules, the deck
should have decreased because the player should have drawn cards.
The discard deck should have increased because the player discarded
a card. The player should have netted two additional cards in their
hand as well. Additionally, the player should have had two additional 
treasures after the adventurer as well */
