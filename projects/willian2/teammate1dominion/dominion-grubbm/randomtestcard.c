* ASSIGNMENT 5 - randomtestcard.c
* AUTHOR: Nickolas A. Williams
* CLASS: CS362
* DATE: 05/22/2016
* NOTES: random testing Max Grubb's refactored playSmithy() function
* REQUIREMENTS for smithy:
*  1. Player draws exactly three cards
*  2. Cards are drawn only from the player's deck
*  3. Smithy card is discarded
* TESTING tasks for smithy:
*  1. Test that three cards are added to hand
*  2. Test that three cards are drawn from deck
*  3. Test that smithy card was discarded
*  4. Test that if there are <3 cards in deck, 0/1 or -1 cards were added to
*     hand (deck 0 hand -1, deck 1 hand 0, deck 2 hand 1)
*  5. Test that if there are <3 cards in deck, there are no cards left in deck
*  6. Test that if there are <3 cards in deck, smithy still discarded
*  7. Test that other players' hands were not adjusted
*  8. Test that other players' decks were not adjusted
*  9. Test that other players' discards were not adjusted
