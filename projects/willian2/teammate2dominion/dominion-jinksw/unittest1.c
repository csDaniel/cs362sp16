/******************************************************************************
* ASSIGNMENT 5 - unittest1.c
* AUTHOR: Nickolas A. Williams
* CLASS: CS362
* DATE: 05/22/2016
* NOTES: unit testing of the discardCard() function
* REQUIREMENTS for discardCard():
*  1. If card is not to be trashed, it must be placed in the played card pile
*  2. If card is to be trashed, it must count as removed from play (trash pile)
*  3. Only this card should be discarded
*  4. Only this player should have discarded
* TESTING tasks for discardCard():
*  1. Test if trashflag = 1, card is not placed in discard pile, 
*     playedCardCount is not incremented
*  2. Test if trashflag < 1, card is placed in discard pile and playedCardCount
*     is incremented
*  3. Test if last card is discarded, hand is empty
*  4. Test if only card is played, hand is empty
*  5. Test if hand is full (MAX_HAND cards in hand), and discardCard() is 
*     called MAX_HAND - 1 times, the last remaining card is the first card
*     in the hand
*  6. Test that no other players are affected by discardCard()
